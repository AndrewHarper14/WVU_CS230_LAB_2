Also, each part represents a logically cohesive unit and you can easily watch the video you need at the moment instead of having to scroll to numerous 3 hours of lab recordings.

Here are some examples to give you ideas: 'Example Web Sites/Apps'. The Web Apps you chose must have a Desktop version. For example, TikTok is NOT a candidate for this. I will review your submissions and decide if they are appropriate for the labs. If not we will find an alternative. If appropriate we will choose one of them for you to work on. If you have not filled in the survey please do so: 'CS 230 Pre-course survey'. Submission: Just submit three links or screenshots in the submission section below. Regards, Nikola",
